# While Loop
# Print Number From 10 To 20

a = 10

while(a <= 20):    #(a=10 <= 20) the condition is True; therefore excute conditional code.
	               #when condition is true then excute conditional code; otherwise loop body skipped.
	#The Body of Loop 
	print "the value of a is:",a  #"print" use for printline
	a=a+1 #a++ for this condition 'a <= 20'. value increase upto 20




#OUTPUT
#the value of a is: 10
#the value of a is: 11

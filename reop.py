#Relation(Comparison) Operator

a = 21
b = 10

#Equal To
print  "a==b is",a==b;  #(a=21 == b=10) is False; Therefore a is not equal to b.
             					#the two given values are equal to each other then result will be True, Otherwise it returns False.
#Not Equal to 
print  "a!=b is",a!=b;

#Grater Than
print  "a>b is",a>b; #(a=21 > b=10) is True; Therefore a is grater than b.
                                 #the first value is grater than the second value then result will be True, Otherwise it returns False.

#Less Than
print  "a<b is",a<b; #(a=21 < b=10) is False; Therefore a is not less than b.
                               #the first value is less than the second value then result will be True, Otherwise it returns False.

#Grater Than or Equal To
print  "a>=b is",a>=b; #(a=21 >= b=10) is True; Therefore a is grater than or equal to b.
                                           #the first value is grater than or equal to the second value then result will be True, Otherwise it returns False.

#Less Than or Equal To
print  "a<=b is",a<=b; #(a=21 <= b=10) is False; Therefore a is not less than or equal to  b.
                                         #the first value is less than or equal to  the second value then result will be True, Otherwise it returns False.


#OUTPUT
# a==b is False
# a!=b is True
# a>b is True
# a<b is False
# a>=b is True
# a<=b is False

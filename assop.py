#Assignment Operators


a = 31
c = 9

#Add AND
c += a # c = c + a; 9 + 31 = 40
print ("the addition is :",c)

#Subtract AND
c -= a # c = c - a; 40 - 31 = 9
print ("the substraction is :",c)

#Multiply AND
c *= a # c = c * a; 9 * 31 = 279
print ("the multiply is :",c)

#Division AND
c /= a # c = c /a; 279/31 = 9.0
print ("the division is :",c)

#Mod AND
c %= a # c = c % a; 9.0 % 31  = 9.0
print ("the modulos is :",c)



#Output
#the addition is : 40
#the substraction is : 9
#the multiply is : 279
#the division is : 9.0
#the modulos is : 9.0
